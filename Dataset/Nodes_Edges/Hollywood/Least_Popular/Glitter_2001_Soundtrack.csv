The first single, 'Loverboy', peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, but only after Virgin Records spurred sales of the single by dropping the price down to 99 cents."
glitter (soundtrack),carey's breakdown,"Carey was unable to film a music video for the single, 'Never Too Far', as she was still recovering from her breakdown. Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert."
