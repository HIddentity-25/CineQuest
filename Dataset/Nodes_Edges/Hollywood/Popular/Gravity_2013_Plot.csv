space shuttle explorer,international space station (iss),"Explorer crew and ISS crew communicate regularly through Mission Control in Houston. Explorer is en route to service the Hubble Space Telescope, but debris from a destroyed satellite forces them to return to Earth immediately. However, Explorer suffers catastrophic damage, and both Kowalski and Stone are stranded in space with limited time before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again. They decide to use MMUs to reach the ISS, which is in orbit about 1,450 km away."
matthew 'matt' kowalski,dr. ryan stone,"Kowalski and Stone are crew members aboard the Space Shuttle Explorer on a mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope. During a spacewalk, they encounter a rapidly expanding cloud of space debris caused by a destroyed satellite. Debris strikes both the Explorer and the Hubble, leaving Stone tumbling through space and forcing Kowalski to rescue her using a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU)."
matthew 'matt' kowalski,international space station (iss),"As the two crew members from Explorer approach the ISS, they see that the ISS's crew has evacuated using one of its two Soyuz vehicles. This suggests a communication and collaboration relationship between Kowalski and the ISS."

stone,kowalski,"trying to grab onto the ISS; the duo's tether snags on one of the station's solar panels. Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both."
kowalski,stone,detaches himself from the tether to save her from drifting away with him.

stone,soyuz,"cannot re-establish communication with Kowalski or Earth, and concludes that she is now the sole survivor."
soyuz,tangled parachute tethers,"preventing the spacecraft from leaving; Stone performs a spacewalk to cut the cables, succeeding just as the debris field returns, destroying the station."
stone,tiangong,"Stone manages to enter Tiangong's Shenzhou capsule just as the station enters the upper atmosphere, undocking the capsule just in time. The Shenzhou capsule re-enters the atmosphere successfully, despite damage during its descent, and lands in a lake."
soyuz,tiangong,"As she begins to lose consciousness, she experiences a hallucination of Kowalski entering the capsule and telling her to rig the Soyuz's soft landing rockets to propel the capsule towards Tiangong. Stone regains the will to go on, restoring the spacecraft's oxygen flow and rigging the landing rockets to propel the capsule towards Tiangong. Unable to dock with Tiangong, Stone ejects herself from the Soyuz and uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel to the rapidly deorbiting Tiangong."
stone,soyuz,"Stone angles the Soyuz towards Tiangong, but soon discovers that the Soyuz's engine has no fuel. After an attempt at radio communication with an Inuit on Earth, Stone resigns herself to her fate and shuts off the cabin's oxygen supply to commit suicide."
